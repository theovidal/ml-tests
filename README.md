# Miscellaneous Machine Learning code

**Little projects I code to learn machine learning algorithms and data science processes.**

## What I developed

In chronological order, starting from July 2024:

- [Simple linear regression](./linear-regression)
- [IMDB sentiment classification with MLP and CNN](./classification)
- [A Kaggle classification competition](./kaggle-mushroom)
- [Weather forecast with timeseries and RNN](./timeseries)
- [Cats and Dogs image classification with CNN](./cats-dogs-images), with a deep dive into what the model learns (printing the patterns)
- [[WIP] Translation with a Transformer model](./attention)
- [Hi! Paris Data Bootcamp](./hi-paris-bootcamp): a one-week training on data cleaning, visualization, ML and explainability, with ethics considerations and business cases

## What I learned

Using Numpy, Pandas and TensorFlow (with Keras):

- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Autoencoders
- Attention blocks and Transformer architecture
- Cleaning and visualizing structured data, text, images, timeseries
- Explainability of a model

I compiled all theoretical notions I learned on a [single Notion page](https://theovld.fr/l/apprentissage) (in French only for the moment).

## My projects around ML

- [Beta project](https://github.com/theovidal/beta-project): using AI for rock climbing, for instance predicting route grades or generating new routes
- [Go Neural](https://github.com/theovidal/go-neural): implementing a neural network from scratch in Go

## Credits

Here are all the resources I used to code these projects:

- [TensorFlow documentation](https://tensorflow.org)
- [F. Chollet - Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)
